1) How should the employees who approve the request be assigned
    are they determined when the employee submits the request or can it change

    - ex if an MET TA submits a request -> 
    HR_Rep_MET + MET_Dean should approve the request

    or could there be cases where for example the HR_Rep_IET approve
    given that the HR_Rep_MET is available

Cause look at 2.5) m 
It doesnt specify who is approving the request, so the person who approves 
the request could be random

so do we assign the employee_approves_leave heirarchy when the employee requests a 
leave, or do we wait till the very end and check who approved the request?

if its assigned previously, who will approve if the HR_Rep_MET is on leave?

how many HR_Rep are there per departement

if it should be a pool of requests and each employee approves a bunch of leaves
    what about the dr

-- If the HR_MET_Representative is on leave and a TA from MET requests a leave, who will accept
-- Do we treat pending status as accepted when checking who should approve the request

-- Who is the higher ranking employee in Unpaid_Leave, is it the direct or 
	can for example the president approve requests for a TA




2) Order of the execution of functions

-- When processing deductions, do we assume that the remove_leave has been called previously?
-- When processing HR_approves_Leave, do we assume that the leave has been processed by the Dean, ...



3) Random questions
-- Can we take more than one compensation leave per month given that we have sufficed the replacement days

-- If an Employee submits a leave that should be automatically rejected, so we stll 
	forward it to the HR? and do we add it into the Leave table?

-- What happens when the HR_manager is on leave?

-- Is the replacement employee set before or after the annual leave request?
	i.e do i request or then look for a replacement, or look for a replacement then make the request

-- Are president/HR approval procedures executed automatically after applying for a leave request 
    i.e when checking the person reviewing the request, does he have to not be on leave NOW?

-- Can both dean and vice dean have an accidental/medical leave at the same time?
		if so then how do we process the leaves they are required to approve

-- Is medical dr added to the heirarchy in Medical leave

-- Will the request be approved by HR if the employee has sufficient balance?

-- 2.5 m) what does he mean memo document is submitted and a valid reason

-- Who is the dr/HR_Rep that approves the Medical Leave? or is it random
